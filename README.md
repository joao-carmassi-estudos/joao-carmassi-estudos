# 📚 joao-carmassi-studies  

Welcome to my **study projects** organization! 🚀  
Here you’ll find all the material I’ve used (and still use) to practice, experiment, and learn new technologies throughout my journey as a developer.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this organization is to **centralize my practice projects**, separated from my main profile, which focuses on real projects, professional challenges, and business solutions.  
If you want to check my study history and dedication, this is the right place. ✅  

## 🛠️ Explored Technologies  
In this organization you’ll find projects built with:  

- 🌐 **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** — my first steps in web development  
- 🌀 **TypeScript** — diving deeper into typing and best practices  
- 🖼️ **Vue.js** — framework I explored during my study period  
- ⚛️ **React.js** — my current focus, with lots of practice material  
- 🔗 **Next.js** — exploring SSR, SSG, and the fullstack ecosystem  
- 🧩 **Context API & Redux** — state management in React applications  

## 🤝 Why make it public?  
- To showcase the evolution of my studies over time 📈  
- To share with other devs who are also learning 👨‍💻👩‍💻  
- To clearly separate my **practice projects** from my **professional projects**
